Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,
But that thou none lovâ€™st is most evident:
For thou art so possessed with murderous hate,
Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,
Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:
Make thee another self for love of me,
That beauty still may live in thine or thee.
